Hello hello hellooo! ðŸŽ¶

I'm a lucky and curious designer with +6 years of experience in creative and technological projects.

I design digital brands and products that respect, help and empower people to improve our lives.

I mostly work in the intersection of user interface design, technology & culture. 
I love and believe in new media and code as much as typography, editorial and product design.

In the past, I have worked on the fascinating worlds of mobility, telecommunications services, fashion and journalism.

I love to meet and share experiences with new people. Would you wanna talk? hi@rafagarces.com
