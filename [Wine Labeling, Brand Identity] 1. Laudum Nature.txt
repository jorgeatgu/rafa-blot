# Laudum Nature

**Marina** <br> *tetas locas*

You can use *Markdown*, a lightweight markup language for plain text files.

**This text will be bold.**

To create italics, use a single asterix (*) on either side of the text:
*This text will be italic.*
Both * or _ symbols work to make text bold or italic. This way you can combine bold and italic in the same sentence. For example:

**Everyone _must_ listen.**

Use one octothrope "#" to create a subheading.
# Largest heading

Use two octothropes "##" to create a subheading.
## Subheading

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Alternative heading

----------------------

Create a text link by wrapping the linked text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the link in parenthesis ( ). For example:
[Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org)

For images use the syntax for a link, with an exclamation point (!) in front. For example:

![Image title](http://www.risasinmas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/perro-lengua-rsm-600x600.jpg)


Make a bulleted list by preceding list items with a single hyphen (-) or an asterix (*).
You need a space between the hyphen and the text.
- Round
* Shell
- Projectile

Create a numbered list by preceding list items with a number.
1. Eins
2. Deux
3. Tres

Indent code with four spaces:

    var foo = “bar”;
You can also wrap code with three backticks (`) and specify the language to enable syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = "bar";
```


Blockquotes
Markdown uses email-style > characters for block quoting. They are presented as:

> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs.
>
> This is the second pragraph. Vestibulum enim wisi.
