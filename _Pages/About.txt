Hi! ðŸ‘½

My name is Rafa GarcÃ©s.

I am a joyful human and a curious Brand & Product Designer.

I design digital products that respect, delight, and empower every human being to achieve their goals.

This allows me to fulfill my life's purpose of inspiring a more joyful world, by designing and seizing life's small sparkly moments âœ¨

I work as a Freelance designing the simplest path to delivering apps and creating experiences loved by developers worldwide.

In the past, I worked on the fascinating worlds of mobility, (Tuenti??), fashion, graphic design studios and journalism.
